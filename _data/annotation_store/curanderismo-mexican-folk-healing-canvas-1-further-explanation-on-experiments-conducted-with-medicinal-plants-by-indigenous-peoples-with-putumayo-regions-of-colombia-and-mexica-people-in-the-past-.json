But a friend of mine is a phytochemist, somebody studies the chemistry of plants. Spent a long season with a curandero in Colombia up a river called the Putumayo Region. And he found that this curandero kept monkeys around, that he seemed to be experimenting with the monkeys, giving drugs to the monkeys to see what effects they would do, which is very advanced because monkeys are the best animal model of humans that we have and we use at the final stage in testing drugs. Before humans, we use monkeys. And so that's very sophisticated. We have some indications that the Aztecs also did some research and investigations in plants in an experimental, empirical way, not just a magical approach. ",
